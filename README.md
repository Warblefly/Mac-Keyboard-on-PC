Plug in a British Mac external keyboard, and use on a PC

Someone from the UK has given you a Mac USB keyboard, and you'd like to use it on a Windows PC?

This is a Windows driver for that keyboard. Many composition keys work; and the 'hash' key is, as usual, hidden under the Alt-3 keystroke. The included Registry file allows F13, F14 and F15 to be multimedia audio volume down, up and mute keys.
